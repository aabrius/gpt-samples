# Display an Offerwall with Custom Choice

This example demonstrates how to display an Offerwall on your website and
present a custom choice to users. Learn more about Offerwall in the
[Google Ad Manager help center][admanager_hc_offerwall].

Adding a custom choice lets you implement your own monetization solution
as an additional user selectable option within your Offerwall. For example, you
might let visitors purchase a subscription to access more content. For more
information about custom choice, see
[Set up a "custom choice" user choice][admanager_hc_offerwall_customchoice].

## Usage notes

*   You must write and deploy your own code to use the custom choice
    feature. Enabling custom choice without a correct implementation will result
    in Offerwall not displaying to end users.
*   The location and text of your custom choice is previewable in the
    [message builder in Privacy & messaging][admanager_hc_create_message].
    However, you can't preview the custom UI that displays after users select
    your custom choice from Google Ad Manager. Your custom code defines the look
    and behavior of the UI.
*   You can only add one custom choice to an Offerwall.
